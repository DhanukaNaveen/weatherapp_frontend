# Weather App 🌦️

A full-stack **Weather App** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application allows users to authenticate securely, view real-time weather data for cities, and manage their personalized weather information. It integrates the **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather data and **Auth0** for secure user authentication, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- An **Auth0** account to manage user authentication credentials

## ⚙️ Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory with the following variables:

```
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key  
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your_auth0_domain  
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the app running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repositories

Clone both the frontend and backend repositories from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/DhanukaNaveen/weatherapp_frontend.git
